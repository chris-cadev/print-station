## Raspberry Pi Printing Station

This project sets up a printing station using a Raspberry Pi and allows you to connect it to a web application built with Svelte. The printing station is configured using the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) and communicates with the web application using a JavaScript library to interact with the CUPS API.

## Requirements

To set up the printing station, you will need:

- A Raspberry Pi running a compatible operating system, such as Raspberry Pi OS.
- A printer that is compatible with Raspberry Pi and has the necessary drivers installed.
- The CUPS server software installed on your Raspberry Pi.
- The CUPS web interface installed on your Raspberry Pi to manage printers and print jobs.

To connect to the printing station from a web application built with Svelte, you will need to use a JavaScript library to interact with the CUPS API. You can use libraries such as "node-cups" or "cups-api" to communicate with the CUPS API.

## Setting up the Printing Station

To set up the printing station, follow these steps:

1.  Install the CUPS server software and web interface on your Raspberry Pi. You can do this using the following command:

```
bashsudo apt-get install cups cups-webinterface

```

2.  Connect your printer to your Raspberry Pi and make sure it is recognized by the operating system. You may need to install drivers for your printer if they are not already included in your operating system.
3.  Configure the CUPS server to recognize your printer. You can do this by opening a web browser on your Raspberry Pi and going to [http://localhost:631](http://localhost:631/). From there, you can add your printer to the CUPS server.
4.  Configure the CUPS server to allow access from other devices on your network. You can do this by editing the CUPS configuration file at /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and adding the following line:

5.  Restart the CUPS server using the following command:

```
bashsudo systemctl restart cups

```

6.  Configure your web application to interact with the CUPS API using a JavaScript library such as "node-cups" or "cups-api".

## Connecting to the Printing Station from a Svelte Web Application

To connect to the printing station from a Svelte web application, you can use a JavaScript library to interact with the CUPS API. You can install the "node-cups" library using npm:

```
bashnpm install node-cups

```

Once installed, you can use the library to interact with the CUPS API and manage print jobs. For example, to print a file, you could use the following code:

```
javascriptconst cups = require('node-cups');

const printer = cups.getDefaultPrinterName();
const jobOptions = {
  media: 'A4',
  n: 1
};

const filename = 'example.pdf';

cups.printFile(printer, filename, jobOptions, (err, response) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(response);
  }
});

```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can set up a printing station using a Raspberry Pi and connect it to a Svelte web application. This allows you to manage print jobs from your web application and print files directly from the Raspberry Pi.
